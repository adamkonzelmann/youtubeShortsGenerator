I (32f) have been married to my ex "Dan" (35m) for 6 years before we divorced at the end of 2020 due to him cheating with "Kate".

Kate and Dan have a son who is 3 which was conceived and born during the pandemic while I was under high risk and their entire affair has cost me some of my physical health, not just mental one. After the divorce Dan moved out from my house and we haven't spoken since.
