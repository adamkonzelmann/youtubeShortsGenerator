A lot of people have asked me for updates so I thought id make one.

It was kind of positive?

I agreed with many comments in my first post where they said my grandparents were setting me up for drama.

I talked to my grandparents and shared these concerns. They were understanding and setup a family meeting with them, their lawyer, my dad, his wife, and myself.

I was secretly hoping that my grandparents would get over some of their issues with my dad and his wife but nope. My dad's wife actually started crying and wailing when they revealed that I would be getting most of the inheritance. I could see my grandmother almost exploding. My dad to his credit, looked disappointed but said it was their money to do as they wished.

The new agreement is that my father will receive $75k, and each of my younger siblings will receive a 50K education fund.

My dad's wife did call me a few days later and acted really foolishly. And she somehow thought that insulting my mother would help her.

I told her that if she ever said something bad about my mother again I would tell my grandparents about it. That seems to have shut her up.

My relationship with my dad was never the greatest. But I haven't really seen any further decline in the relationship.

But I feel a lot of relief now. Thanks everyone!
